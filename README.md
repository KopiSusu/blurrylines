# Blurrylines

Blurrylines is an AI-powered tool that generates unique thumbnail images by removing the original human subject in a photo and replacing them with an AI-generated individual, all while preserving the existing background. This allows creators to produce fresh, eye-catching visuals without altering the original setting.

## How It Works

1. **Extraction**: Blurrylines identifies and isolates the human subject in an image.
2. **AI Replacement**: A new, AI-generated individual is composited into the original photo in place of the removed subject.
3. **Background Consistency**: The original environment remains untouched, ensuring each thumbnail retains its overall context.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Subject Detection**: Employs machine learning techniques to detect and remove human subjects accurately.  
- **AI-Generated Replacements**: Uses cutting-edge generative models to create new human figures that blend seamlessly.  
- **Consistent Environments**: Keeps the original background intact, preserving color, lighting, and scene structure.  
- **Customizable**: Allows parameters for controlling the appearance of the generated individual.
